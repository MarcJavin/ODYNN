ODYNN stands for Optimization for DYnamic Neural Network.
ODYNN is designed for simulating and optimizing biological neural circuits to model multi-scale behaviors exhibited by the neural dynamics, and to test neuroscience related hypotheses.
It is enhanced with features such as performing experiments with different biophysically realistic neuronal models as well as artificial recurrent neural networks (in particular long short term memory), incorporating calcium imaging data, to design arbitrarily structured neural circuits and optimizing them to govern specific behaviors.
